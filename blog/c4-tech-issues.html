      <div class="blog_content">
        <p>There are lots of problems facing the Bay Area's tech industry, such as sexism, diversity and housing that have been covered in blogs, newspapers and social media.  There is one problem, however, that doesn't recieve much coverage.  Drugs are a burgeoning problem in Silicon Valley and the tech industry in general.  Young workers face long hours, intense competition and punishing deadlines and when coupled with tons of disposable income can lead to an explosive problem.  Workaholism is rampant in this industry and programmers often self-medicate with street drugs in order to increase their effectiveness.  Large tech companies even set up their campuses to keep you on site as much as possible.  In order to stay up for days at a time, some workers will turn to adderall, meth or cocaine in order to meet their deadlines and heroin and painkillers to take the edge off when they get home.  The recent fatal overdose of Google executive, Forest Hayes, threw a spotlight on the industry's growing problem.  Silicon Valley faces a huge a problem with it's current fast-paced tech culture and it's location on one of the most productive drug routes in the country.  Tech companies don't often question how their employees crank out code as long as they can maintain their blistering pace and meet their deadlines.  Tech companies often drug test their blue-collar workers, but not their programmers allowing them to continue to self-medicate.</p>

        <p>I think that more attention needs to be drawn to the issue.  As long as the tech industry's workaholic culture continues, the addiction rates will continue to soar.  A few major tech companies provide drug and alcohol counselling their employees, but these services are often not enough to deal with severe drug addiction.  Even though these in-house services are confidential, employees refuse to use them fearing that their addictions will cost them their jobs or cause them to be stigmatized among their colleagues.  Treatment centers throughout the nation have already noticed a major increase in young tech workers checking into their facilities.  I'm honestly surprised that there haven't been more overdoses in Silicon Valley already.  These companies refuse to publicly acknowledge the issue due to the bad publicity it will bring.  The industry needs to emphasize emphatically that they will face no repercussions for recieving treatment and that their confidentiality will be maintained.  Companies also need to make their employees valued feeling like they aren't disposable.  These tech companies need to do more to decrease their employees' stress so they won't need to self-medicate in order to alleviate their stress.  The Bay Area got hit hard by the oxycodone boom which lead to the current heroin boom.  Hard drugs are cheaper than prescribed painkillers and even easier to get.  This is not an issue that will soon resolve itself unless companies recognize this massive problem and work together to find a solution.</p>
