        <p>The three things that I can agree with in this exercise are adventure, enthusiasm and music</p>

        <p>I feel like you won't get very far in life without adventure and a sense of adventure.  My definition of adventure is being excited by excitement and immersing myself in something that's far away from my comfort zone.  This is usually applied to travelling and this is usually how I feel when travelling.  I like to get far away from home and my comfort zone to see what life is like for others.  I love to see how people live differently than the way we do back home.  I feel like that that's what Dev BootCamp will be like once we finally make it onsite.  I know that I will be constantly challenged and very far from my comfort zone.</p>

        <p>I think that enthusiasm is mandatory in order to complete Dev BootCamp.  This program is incredibly challenging and time consuming and if I didn't have any enthusiasm, I wouldn't have even made it past Phase 0.  I would spend hours sometimes on these challenges and if I got stuck, I would go to bed thinking that Dev BootCamp made a mistake in accepting me into their program.  Sheer Enthusiasm got me through those tough days and will hopefully get me through those days at DBC where I feel like slamming my head on my desk.</p>

        <p>I love music and I'm almost always listening to music while I code.  Sometimes, I feel like music has had a huge affect on maintaining my concentration.  I love going to concerts as well and have easily been to two or three hundred concerts.  It's the best way to experience music and you get to see how it affects people as well.  I was watching an interview with Bjarne Stroustrup and he said that he constantly listens to music when he codes.  He says that it's important to not make music overpower one's thinking capabilities.</p>
