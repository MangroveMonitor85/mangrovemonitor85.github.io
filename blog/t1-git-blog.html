  <h2>My Life So Far...</h2>

    <p>
      By the way, I had no idea that it would be this easy to post a page prototype!
    </p>

    <p>
      My name is Piara.  I was born in SF, however, I've lived in Pinole, CA (the East Bay) since I was born.  I went to high school at Campolindo High in Moraga and graduated in 2003.  After that I went to UC Santa Cruz which is located in small beach, surf town an hour and a half south of the San Francisco.  Santa Cruz was the perfect place to study fisheries biology and I love the time that I spent there and still keep in touch with tons of friends from my college days.

      After graduation, I got a job at a radiochemistry company testing water and soil samples for uranium, plutonium, thorium, tritium and carbon-14. Unfortunately, I only worked there for a year due to the downsizing of all new employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had an incredibly hard time finding a job after that, because the economy was in the tank, so I ended up volunteering at the California Academy of Sciences under Dr. Terry Gosliner.  While I was there, I developed a more detailed method to catalogue his existing specimen slide collection.
    </p>

      Finally, I found some on and off temp work at Union Bank for the next two years.  After I finished out my contract there, I got a job at a law firm, where I was their records clerk.  I found working at a law firm to be deeply unsatisfying so I decided that I was going to go back to school.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took some Java and a C++ classes and studied French.  While at the law firm, I discovered Dev BootCamp and other intensive developer programs.  I was contemplating going back to school to earn another Bachelors, this time in CS.  I decided on learning programming with the dev programs, because they had an actual incentive to help you find a job at the end, whereas universities have none at all.

    <h2>Reflections to Consider</h2>

    <p>
      Version control is absolutely mandatory in this day and age of user-driven consumer technology.  Software is increasing in complexity at a blistering rate and bugs can destroy months if not years of hard work.  Being able to roll back to a previous stable release is critical.  So much technology nowadays is user-driven and constantly updated.  We all have smart phones, video game systems, tablets, tvs and music players; all of which require constant software updates to stay current.  One is constantly hearing of buggy updates and while the developers fix the bugs in these updates, the users must be able to downgrade to a previous stable verion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git helps developers track their changes through commits and commit messages.  These two items are tracked locally in our git repos.  Commits are incredibly important, but commit messages are even more important.  These messages allow a developer to keep track of which changes each commit made.  Therefore, it is good practice to write good commit messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main advantage of GitHub is that everyone in the team can access the code without having to email each other files or pass around flash drives.  Everyone in the team can access and modify the code, while having other team members double check the updates you've made.  With GitHub you can easily pull all of the updates to the current repository right into your local repo.
