    <h1>Reflections to Consider</h1>

      Version control is absolutely mandatory in this day and age of user-driven consumer technology.  Software is increasing in complexity at a blistering rate and bugs can destroy months if not years of hard work.  Being able to roll back to a previous stable release is critical.  So much technology nowadays is user-driven and constantly updated.  We all have smart phones, video game systems, tablets, tvs and music players; all of which require constant software updates to stay current.  One is constantly hearing of buggy updates and while the developers fix the bugs in these updates, the users must be able to downgrade to a previous stable verion.

      Git helps developers track their changes through commits and commit messages.  These two items are tracked locally in our git repos.  Commits are incredibly important, but commit messages are even more important.  These messages allow a developer to keep track of which changes each commit made.  Therefore, it is good practice to write good commit messages.

      The main advantage of GitHub is that everyone in the team can access the code without having to email each other files or pass around flash drives.  Everyone in the team can access and modify the code, while having other team members double check the updates you've made.  With GitHub you can easily pull all of the updates to the current repository right into your local repo.
