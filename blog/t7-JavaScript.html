      <div class="blog_content">
        <p>When I first started working on JavaScript and I wanted to take a peek at the document, I noticed that it was not anywhere as comprehensive as the Ruby documentation.  The fact that Ruby's docs might be so good is one of the main reasons that Ruby is recommended for beginners.  It is incredibly important to be able to read and understand documentation easily in the beginning.  If the documentation is too complicated for a beginner, they will be put off thinking that programming is much harder than it actually is.  JavaScript is not a language that is recommended for beginners.</p>

        <p>When I was working on the numbers comma challenge with my partner, we hard more difficulty with the JavaScript documentation then we did with the Ruby documentation.  It took us longer to find functions and it also took us longer to figure out how to use the functions.  We had to search all over the Internet for documentation, but with Ruby all we needed was the Ruby documentation.</p>

        <p>I think that Ruby's documentation is easier to read is because that a lot of beginner's learn Ruby and people that are using JavaScript are usually more experienced with programming in general if they are dealing with concepts such as front-end and back-end.  JavaScript has different frameworks as well, the popular ones being Node.js, Angular.js, BackBone.js and Ember.js.  Each of these frameworks are slightly different and they have have slightly different documentation.  The only differences between Ruby is between the previous versions.</p>
