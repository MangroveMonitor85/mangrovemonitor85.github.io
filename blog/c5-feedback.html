        <p>I think that working with others during our challenges and our guided pairing sessions has been a huge help.  These challenges can be quite difficult sometimes and it really helps to work through the problems with a partner.  Each pair brings something different to the table when working through these challenges.  I've learned so much when partnering with someone else and it's also helped me to explain concepts to others in order to solidify my own knowledge.  Programmers almost always work in teams and it's incredibly important to be able to work together.  Pair programming also teaches us to work together and to deal with our different programming styles and personalities.  It's good to drill this into us early.  I haven't had any trouble with my programming partners so far and I've actually enjoyed the experience.  I haven't had any problems during pair programming and it's actually reduced a huge amount of frustration when I'm having trouble during a challenge.</p>

        <p>I enjoy looking through the feedback that I've recieved in order and it let's me know the changes that I need to make.  All of the feedback that I've recieved has been really nice and helpful.  I know from the feedback that I've recieved that I need to drive a little more.  I feel more comfortable navigating, but I definitely need to drive more.  I've never really given feedback like this before so it definitely took me a few tries before I was able to write actual feedback.  I still have a little bit of trouble giving feedback because everyone that I've worked with has been solid and really great to work with.  I'm also relatively insecure with my abilities so I feel kind of uneasy rating other people's abilities.  All of my partners so far are really talented and have been great to work with.  We've all worked so well with each other and we got our work done so quickly and efficiently that I had a difficult time actually thinking of constructive critiscm to give.  Most of the time I'm the one that needs feedback.  The fact that Dev BootCamp requires us to rate feedback is really helpful because I can use it to see how others give feedback.  I've rated a lot of feedback and so far all of it has been overwhelmingly positive.  I haven't seen anyone write anything negative about each other so far.</p>
