          I've come across a lot of really great questions while trying to find answers to my programming questions.  These questions are clear, concise, specific, well researched and well thought out.  There are thousands of questions asked on StackOverFlow and other related sites every single day.  It seems like a lot of the questions that are asked are questions that have been asked many times before.  A lot of these questions aren't very specific at all.  In order for the question to be of use, you need to be as specific as possible.  I think that the best piece of advice that I saw on the Stack OverFlow website was to pretend that you are asking a busy colleague.  It says to try to sum up the problem as a single sentence.
        </p>

        <p>
          A lot of the questions that didn't get answered were badly written, poorly thought out or had been answered many times already.  I could tell that the author didn't spend too much time trying to find the answer himself.  Sometimes the questions even ask the answerer to do the bulk of the work!  People get much better answers if they ask better questions and copy in code to prove that you are at least trying to solve your coding problem.

        <ol id="tipsList">
          <li>Pretend you are asking a busy colleague, so keep it short</li>
          <li>Ask one thing at a time</li>
          <li>Follow general questions with specific questions</li>
          <li>Don't ask yes or no questions </li>
          <li>Don't interrupt and listen fully to what they are saying</li>
          <li>Wait in silence even after they finish explain</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Learning how to ask questions properly is a vital skill to hone when learning how to code.  It's also incredibly helpful to learn how to ask questions in person and online.  You many not have constant exposure to either, so you need to learn how to formulate a question differently.  Learning how to code requires the help of an entire community.
