    <h3>Padding vs. Margins vs. Borders</h3>
    <h4>This is a tough topic, however, I will do my best to explain!</h4>

      Padding is an intrinsic part of an element and always stays part of an element.  So elements that have padding between them will never have any overlap, because that space is part to the element.  The click area and background color are also included within the padding of the element.  Padding is also used to move elements away from a block or margin.  I would use padding if I wanted to increase the space between an element and an image, say.  Padding will also be used if I wanted to make a button link bigger, because it also adds height and width, whereas margins do not increase the size of an element.

      Margins are not part of the element, unlike padding, and margins of elements adjacent to each other will overlap if close enough.  Margins are also used to separate a block from elements outside of it, such as a block of text.  Most developers use margins to create some kind of distance between itself and other elements on the site.  The diagram shows that the margins lay outside of the padding.
