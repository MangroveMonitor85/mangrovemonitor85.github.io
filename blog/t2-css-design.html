    <h3>Padding vs. Margins vs. Borders</h3>
    <h4>This is a tough topic, however, I will do my best to explain!</h4>

      I know that padding is part of an element and always stays part of an element.  So elements that have 5em of padding between them will never have any overlap, because that space is intrinsic to that element.  The click area and background color are also included within the padding, because it is, like I said earlier, a part of the element.  Padding is also used to move elements away from a block.  I would use padding if I wanted to increase the space between an element and an image, say.

      Margins are not part of the element, unlike padding, and margins of elements adjacent to each other will overlap if close enough.  Margins are also used to separate a block from elements outside of it, such as a block of text.
