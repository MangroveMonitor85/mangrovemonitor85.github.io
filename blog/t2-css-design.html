    <h3>Padding vs. Margins vs. Borders</h3>
    <h4>This is a tough topic, I, however, will do my best to explain!</h4>

    <p>
      I know that padding is part of an element and always stays part of an element.  So elements that have 5em of padding between them will never have any overlap, because that space is intrinsic to that element.
