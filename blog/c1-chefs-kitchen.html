  <h2>Learning How to Learn at Dev BootCamp</h2>

      One of the things that drew me to Dev BootCamp is their emphasis on "emotional intelligence".  Learning how to code is such an ordeal and learning how you learn, work with others and deal with stress is so incredibly important to facilate learning overall.  It allows us to view a challenge as the perfect opportunity to grow and to learn instead shying away from the challenge in order to prevent any flaws from potentially being exposed to others.

      I can't wait to get onsite.  I know that I still have two months of gruelling work before I will set foot on campus, but I'm so stoked on it already.  Dev BootCamp is unique in that it's not just about teaching students how to code, but it's also helping them grow as a person.  Everybody has different strengths and different weaknesses and it seems like DBC teaches you how to capitalize on your strengths and weaknesses.  I'm definitely excited to learn how to code, but I'm also extremely excited to learn about myself and to watch myself grow throughout the course, as cheesy as this sounds.

      Everyday I get ever more excited as I find out more and more about DBC's curriculum.  It seems that DBC strives to replicate actual working conditions and I think that is extremely important in reducing the shock that we will potentially face when we get our first job as a developer.  Eventhough, I'm really excited about starting onsite with all of you guys, I'm extremely nervous about it as well.  I know that there will be days when I'm thinking to myself what have I signed up for and what the hell have I gotten myself into?
