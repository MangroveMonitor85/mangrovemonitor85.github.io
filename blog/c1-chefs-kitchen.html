      One of the things that drew me to Dev BootCamp is their emphasis on "emotional intelligence".  Learning how to code is such an ordeal and learning how you learn, work with others and deal with stress is so incredibly important to facilate learning.  It allows us to view a challenge as the perfect opportunity to grow and to learn instead shying away from it to prevent any flaws from potentially being exposed.
