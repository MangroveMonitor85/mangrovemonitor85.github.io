          The last job that I had was at a small law firm in downtown San Francisco where I worked as a records clerk.  I scanned the incoming filings, maintained our e-files, filled in for reception, set up meetings and cleaned our little kitchen.  The last thing that I would do at the end of the day was to clean up the kitchen by wiping up the counters, putting the dishes in the sink and turning on the dishwasher.  Attorneys often work late and eat dinner in the office.  This means that after I left and turned the dishwasher on, they would open up the running dishwasher, put in their dishes and never turn it back on.  I messaged the office and asked that anybody that still had dirty dishes to wash them by hand instead of opening the dishwaster.  This did not work, however, and the problem kept occuring.  My co-worker in the records department would complain to my boss every morning that the dishes were dirty, which happened to be almost every single meeting.  My boss would call me into his office every other morning to lecture me on how I wasn't doing my job.
        </p>

        <p>
          I tried to explain the situation to my boss, but he would never believe me.  It seemed to set the tone of the day and it would frustrate the hell out of me.  I felt disresptected because my coworker would tell me that she never told my boss about the dishwasher, eventhough my boss would tell me that she was the one that would run to him every morning to tell on me.  I felt like I was in grade school all over again.
        </p>

        <p>
          I kept thinking of ways to solve this problem.  I sent mass emails about the dishwasher and I put a sign on the dishwaser, but to no avail.  It got so bad that my co-worker, who happend to be a family friend, that recommended me to the company pulled me aside to talk to me about the problem.  I finally came up with a solution with his help.  I would turn the dishwasher on in front of him every evening before I left to prove to my boss that I was actually turning it on.  The problem, however, kept on occurring, but I was able to prove to my boss that I was not at fault and maybe it was time for him to step in to talk to the attorneys because he had some pull at the firm.
        </p>

        <p>
          The problem with the dishwasher may not have been solved, but at least I was able to prove to my boss that I wasn't culpable in the least.  I could have blown up at him and told him what an asshole he was and why wouldn't he believe me.  Instead, however, I was able to find someone to help me and prove me right.  I didn't let my emotions get the better of me.  I dealt with it in a professional manner and got myself out of trouble.
