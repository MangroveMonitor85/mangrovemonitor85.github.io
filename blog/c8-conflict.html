          The last job that I had was at a small law firm in downtown San Francisco where I worked as a records clerk.  I scanned the incoming filings, maintained our e-files, filled in for reception, set up meetings and cleaned our little kitchen.  The last thing that I would do at the end of the day was to clean up the kitchen by wiping up the counters, putting the dishes in the sink and turning on the dishwasher.  Attorneys often work late and eat dinner in the office.  This means that after I left and turned the dishwasher on, they would open up the running dishwasher, put in their dishes and never turn it back on.  I messaged the office and asked that anybody that still had dirty dishes to wash them by hand instead of opening the dishwaster.  This did not work, however, and the problem kept occuring.  My co-worker in the records department would complain to my boss every morning that the dishes were dirty, which happened to be almost every single meeting.  My boss would call me into his office every time
