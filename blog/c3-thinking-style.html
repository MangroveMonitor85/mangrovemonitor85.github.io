        <p>My thinking style is that of an Abstract Random thinker.  That means that we thrive in highly-dynamic and people-oriented learning environments.  We also learn alot through reflection.  I find that explaining a certain topic to someone else or even to myself when I'm driving or doing chores really helps solidify my knowledge.  It's almost like this information "bakes" into my brain, kind of cheesy explanation, I know.  I used this technique, especially during midterms and finals week when I was at University.  I'm trying to learn French right now and it's a huge help.  I learn alot by explaining things to my cohort mates during our Guided Pairing Sessions and our pairing sessions.  It's also useful to explain these things to my cohort mates, because they can correct me if I make a mistake, so it works both ways.</p>
        
        <p>I also try to read as much as possible as well, I try to read at least one hour a day.  I spend 30 minutes everyday learning French on Duolingo just to keep my mind sharp and so I won't forget the French that I've learned.  Even if you're not super into learning a language, I highly recommend trying to learn a language on Duolingo.  Spending 30 minutes to an hour learning a language everyday increases intelligence and can delay the effects of Alzheimers and dementia.</p>
        
        <p>I also love working on crossword puzzles.  I try to work on one every morning while I drink my coffee and eat breakfast.  It gets my brain going early in the morning and allows my brain to stay sharp through the day.  It's the best "start my day" routine that I've ever devised.  It is hard, however, to fit this stuff into our busy schedule at DBC so I really have to force get going.  They recommend physical exercise at least 30 minutes to an hour every single day and the exact same goes for your brain.</p>
        
        <p>I'm really trying to embrace the "growth" mindset as much as possible.  It's incredibly important to constantly exercise and improve your brain.  Mark Twain said that choosing not to read and being illiterate is the same thing.  No one has any excuse to not improve themselves and how they think.  Most of us aren't born with extremely high or extremely low IQs so we can improve our brains, minds and lives.</p>
